This project captures screenshots, logs keystrokes, records system information, and records audio at regular intervals.

Setup
Install required packages: pynput, Pillow, scipy, sounddevice, requests.
Set file_path and output_folder variables to desired locations.
Ensure the output directory exists.


Usage
Run the script: python your_script_name.py.
Adjust microphone_time, interval_between_screenshots, and duration_to_run as needed.
The script generates key_log.txt, syseminfo.txt, audio.wav, and timestamped screenshots.
